# ID App

The **ID App** (or *TAG ID App*) is a *white-label* Xamarin app written in C# provided by [Trust Anchor Group](https://trustanchorgroup.com/) 
(**TAG** for short). It can be used to create custom apps based on [IEEE P1451.99](https://gitlab.com/IEEE-SA/XMPPI/IoT). This includes:

* Federated & distributed Digital IDs. (Globally scalable, interoperable.)
* Smart Contracts
* Interfaces for communication with devices.
* Ownership, claims & Provisioning.
* End-to-end encrypted communication.
* Peer-to-peer communication.

It is built with .NET Standard 2.0 and Xamarin.Forms 5.0 (Shell), and relies on nugets from the [IoTGateway](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway) 
framework to perform tasks related to communication and functionality defined in IEEE P1451.99.

## Structure

Apart from the app itself, the repository also contains two frameworks:

- Tag.Neuron.Xamarin
- Tag.Neuron.Xamarin.UI

The first wraps the [IoTGateway](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway) framework into a library that is adapted to the mobile phone
environment. It also provides convenience code and app lifecycle support for the Xamarin platform.

The second contains some base classes used to structure and bind UI components for common setup and teardown scenarios that occur
when browsing and using an app. Typically, this includes binding the Appearing/Disappearing events of a page to business logic.
