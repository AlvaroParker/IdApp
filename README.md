# ID App

The **ID App** (or *TAG ID App*) is a *white-label* Xamarin app written in C# provided by [Trust Anchor Group](https://trustanchorgroup.com/) (**TAG** for short).
It can be used to create custom apps based on [IEEE P1451.99](https://gitlab.com/IEEE-SA/XMPPI/IoT). This includes:

* Federated & distributed Digital IDs. (Globally scalable, interoperable.)
* Smart Contracts
* Interfaces for communication with devices.
* Ownership, claims & Provisioning.
* End-to-end encrypted communication.
* Peer-to-peer communication.

It is built with .NET Standard 2.0, Xamarin.Forms 4.8 (Shell) and relies heavily on the [IoTGateway](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway) framework.

## Structure

The app is made up of the actual app itself as well as two frameworks:
- Tag.Neuron.Xamarin
- Tag.Neuron.Xamarin.UI

The first is a wrapper library around the [IoTGateway](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway) framework, making it mobile app friendly, but also
to provide convenience code and app lifecycle support for the Xamarin platform.

The second is the very few base classes needed for correct structuring and binding of UI components for the common setup/teardown scenarios that occur
when browsing/using an app. Typically that means tying the Appearing/Disappearing events of a page to business logic.
